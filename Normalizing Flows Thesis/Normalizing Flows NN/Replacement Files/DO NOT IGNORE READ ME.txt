About this folder: 

The following three files are required if one wants to be able to run the code in this repository. 

There is an assumption being made that you have downloaded CUDA and are attempting to run your code off of a GPU.

While running:
	adam.py
	spline.py
	transformed_distribution.py

the files will generate errors saying that there is a CPU/GPU mismatch. These files make simple fixes to those errors by forcing certain variables to go to the GPU by saying 
	variable.to('cuda')
